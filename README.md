# educational-math-site

This project is a static website meant to empower learning of high end math concepts utilizing runtime visualizations. As this project develops it is my goal to focus strongly on refining the input/output and usability of the tools. This project is strongly dependent on the canvas and is designed for modern browsers.

The build result of this repo can be seen at math-vision.xyz.
